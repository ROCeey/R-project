# Explore Data

The primary objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic dynamics prevalent among households in England, emphasizing the influence of income disparities on living conditions and the differential impact of demographic factors on the socio-economic status of households.

# Insights
The analysis encapsulates a multifaceted relationship between demographic variables and living arrangements. Notably, variables such as marital status, gender, education, income, and age exhibit statistically significant associations with living arrangements ('H8' category). These factors intertwine to influence individuals' preferences for shared or non-shared living spaces. There's a consistent trend indicating that higher income is linked to a decreased likelihood of living in non-shared apartments across various income brackets. Moreover, the clustering analysis unveils distinct income categories, revealing prevalent income brackets—high earners above 200k pounds, middle earners between 80k and 200k pounds, and lower earners below 80k pounds—while highlighting a propensity for higher incomes among shared apartment residents across income brackets. This suggests that despite higher incomes, a considerable proportion of affluent individuals opt for shared living arrangements, showcasing intriguing nuances in socio-economic preferences beyond the conventional assumption of income dictating exclusive living conditions.

# Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis of various demographic factors and their correlation with living arrangements presents a nuanced understanding of socio-economic dynamics. It unveils a complex interplay between income levels, demographic variables, and living preferences. Factors such as marital status, gender, education, and age, in conjunction with income, significantly influence individuals' choices regarding shared or non-shared living spaces. Surprisingly, while higher income generally correlates with a decreased tendency to live in non-shared apartments, a substantial segment of affluent individuals opts for shared living arrangements. **This challenges the conventional belief that higher income inevitably leads to exclusive living conditions**. The clustering analysis further elucidates distinct income categories, emphasizing prevalent income brackets and underscoring a persistent inclination towards shared apartment residency across income brackets.
